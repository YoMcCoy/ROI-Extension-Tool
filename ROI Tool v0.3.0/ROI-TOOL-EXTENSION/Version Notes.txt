Status: Stable

Date: 2025-05-10  
Status: Beta

--------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.2.4  
Date: 2025-05-10  
Status: Beta

- Accurate annualized dividend logic using FMP API
- Fixed all known modal layout and calculation bugs
- ROI logic accounts for covered call caps and correct movement scenarios
- All modal and table logic split into clearer code sections

--------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.3.0  
Date: 2025-05-16  
Status: Release Candidate

[Changes]
- Fully modular JavaScript refactor: all logic split into files for maintainability (`api.js`, `content.js`, `tableUtils.js`, `roiCalc.js`, etc.)
- Uses FMP’s new `/historical-price-full/stock_dividend/` endpoint for accurate dividend calculation; popup always shows latest “forward” annual dividend
- Detects Yahoo SPA/react navigation (URL changes without reload) to keep ROI columns and popup synced to current ticker
- MutationObserver + interval: guarantees ROI columns always stay injected after table redraws
- Only “Calls” table is targeted for ROI injection (never “Puts”)
- Bulletproof cleanup: never duplicates ROI columns or headers, even after rapid ticker changes or DOM mutations
- Defensive table cleanup prevents “ghost” columns or table expansion
- All rookie-friendly notes, debug logs, and section headers preserved for easy onboarding and future development
- Popup now displays Stock Ticker, Current Price, and Forward Annual Dividend
- Code is “plug-and-play” for further new features (real table parsing, ROI styling, etc.)
